# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-in-Python.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. With the rise of digital transactions, ensuring the security of credit card users has become paramount. This project leverages the Random Forest algorithm to identify potential frauds in real-time.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It covers two days, featuring a total of 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent. The dataset poses challenges due to its highly imbalanced nature, with frauds accounting for a mere 0.172% of all transactions.

## Features
* **V1-V28**: Principal components resulting from PCA transformation
* **Time**: Seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first one in the dataset
* **Amount**: Transaction amount
* **Class**: Target variable, where 1 indicates fraud and 0 denotes legitimate transactions

## Challenges
### Key Challenges

* **High Data Volume**: Efficiently processing vast amounts of transaction data daily.
* **Imbalanced Data**: Detecting the rare instances of fraud within a predominantly legitimate dataset.
* **Privacy Concerns**: Ensuring data security and privacy due to the sensitive nature of transaction data.
* **Misclassified Data**: Addressing the issue of undetected or misclassified fraudulent transactions.
* **Adaptive Techniques**: Staying ahead of fraudsters who continually evolve their tactics to bypass detection.

### Strategies

To overcome these challenges, I have adopted the following strategies:

* **Efficiency**: Utilizing a lightweight and fast model for real-time anomaly detection.
* **Privacy**: Implementing data dimensionality reduction techniques to protect user privacy.
* **Data Integrity**: Ensuring high-quality, double-checked data for model training.
* **Simplicity**: Developing a transparent and interpretable model for easy adaptation to new fraud patterns.

## Model Implemented
I have implemented the Random Forest algorithm due to its robustness in handling imbalanced datasets and its ability to capture complex relationships within the data. Random Forest excels in feature importance estimation, making it particularly suitable for our PCA-transformed features. By leveraging ensemble learning, Random Forest mitigates the risks associated with misclassified data and adapts to evolving fraud tactics.
